The Marine Operated Sensing Imaging Stereoscope (M.O.S.I.S) is a project developed by David Repollet Otero as part of his thesis is marine biology. 

# Background info
Organisms such as small sponges, sponge associates, ascidians, corals, coral polyps, coral associates and other benthic organisms are difficult to study in the field and rarely retain their raw in situ characteristics once removed from their natural habitat. To better observe and quantify marine data, we proposed engineering and computational upgrades to Mullen et al. (2015)â€™s Benthic underwater microscope (B.U.M.) design. The purpose is to observe small microscopic organisms in situ and see how their environment affects their livelihood.

# Project
This project implements a system that contains two cameras, a sensor hub and a user interface to control said system. The construction of the prototyope as well as the programming was initially created as part of the ICOM4217 class of the university of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.

This repository houses the code intended for the User Interface and its controls.
